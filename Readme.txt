=>algoritm "heap sort" sorting technique is a research topic given by our instructor muhammad qasim pasta to our group having members 
          "syed umair ahmed (17b-016-se)" "muhammad zain(17b-051-se)" " asma khan(17b-052-se)"

=>this code support visual studio 2010 onwards .net environments

=>working of code: this code sort the unsorted array using min and max heap technique to print the array in ascending or descending order on int numbers 
  generating randomly (you can hard codeed it by removing random function in main) . it Works on having assumption to convert the array into graph using 
  algorithm technique to identify the root element and it's left child and right child .
